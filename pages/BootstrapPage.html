        It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, 
        mobile-first web sites. It solves many problems which we had once, one of which is the 
        cross-browser compatibility issue. Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all the browsers 
        (IE, Firefox and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones). 
        All thanks to Bootstrap developers -Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of Twitter, though it was later 
        declared to be an open-source project.</p></div>
