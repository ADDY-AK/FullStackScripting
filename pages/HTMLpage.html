        images and other content to display it in required format.
         HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0 but the first 
        standard version was HTML 2.0 which was published in 1999.
        Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together.
        Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.
        As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" 
        a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.</p></div>
